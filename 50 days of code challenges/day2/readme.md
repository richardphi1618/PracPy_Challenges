# Day 2

## Challenge: Strings to Integers
Write a function called convert_add that takes a list of strings as an argument and converts it to integers and sums the list. 

### example 
[‘1’, ‘3’, ‘5’] should be converted to [1, 3, 5] and summed to 9.

## Extra Challenge: Duplicate Names
Write a function called check_duplicates that takes a list of strings as an argument. The function should check if the list has any duplicates. If there are duplicates, the function should return the duplicates. If there are no duplicates, the function should return "No duplicates". 

### example
the list of fruits below should return apple as a duplicate and list of names should return "no duplicates".

fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'apple']
names = ['Yoda', 'Moses', 'Joshua', 'Mark']

# Day 10: 

## Challenge: Hide my Password
Write a function called hide_password that takes one parameter. The function takes a a password from a user and returns a hidden password.

### example 
if the user enters ‘hello’ as a password the function should return
`*****`
as a password and tell the user that the password is 5 characters long.

## Extra Challenge: A Thousand Separator
Your new company has a list of figures saved in a list. The issue is that these numbers have no separator. The numbers are saved in the following format:
[1000000, 2356989, 2354672, 9878098].

You have been asked to write a code that will convert each of the numbers in the list into a string. Your code should then add a comma on each number as a thousand separator for readability. When you run your code on the above list, your output should be:

[ '1,000,000', '2,356,989', '2,354,672', '9,878,098’]

Write a function called convert_numbers that will take one argument, a list of numbers above.

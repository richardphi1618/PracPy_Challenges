# Day 12: 

## Challenge: Count the Dots
Write a function called count_dots. This function takes a string separated by dots as a parameter and counts how many dots are in the string. 

### example
‘h.e.l.p.’ should return 4 dots, and ‘he.lp.’ should return 2 dots.

## Extra Challenge: Your Age in Minutes
Write a function called age_in_minutes that tells a user how old they are in minutes. Your code should ask the user to enter their year of birth, and it should return their age in minutes (by subtracting their year of birth to the current year). 

Here are things to look out for:
- The user can only input a 4-digit year of birth. Entering any number longer or less than 4 digits long should render input invalid. Notify the user to input a four digits number.
- If a user enters a year before 1900, your code should tell the user that input is invalid. 
- If the user enters the year The code should run until the user inputs a valid year. 
- Your function should return the user's age in minutes. 

### example
If you enter 1930 you are 48,355,200 minutes old. 1930 is a valid year.

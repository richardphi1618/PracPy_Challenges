## Challenge: Are They Equal?

Write a function called equal_strings. The function takes two strings as arguments and compares them. If the strings are equal (if they have the same characters and have equal length), it should return True, if they are not, it should return False. 

### example

‘love’ and ‘evol’ should return True.

## Extra Challenge: Swap Values
Write a function called swap_values. This function takes a list of numbers and swaps the first element with the last element. 

### example
if you pass [2, 4,67, 7] as a parameter, your function should return [7, 4, 67, 2].
